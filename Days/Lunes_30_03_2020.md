  - Blameless postmortems can help discover the true systemic causes of incidents and proactively address reliability issues. You can use metrics, such as time to resolution or severity, generated across a variety of postmortems to find recurring root causes, and prioritize development to resolve them. Remember that reliability is a feature: the value of reducing the unplanned work of incident management through reliability engineering is just as important as adding more time to development of new features.
  - At the core of all our best practices is empathy towards the on-call engineers: considering their pain points, preparing things to help them, and proactively reducing their burden.
