- We need to have "Appropiate Observability"

- Observability is not logs, metrics and traces. Observability is a capability in our systems that enables us to understand and debug our systems in **production**.

- Observability is not just break-fix. It is our ability to answer any question we may have about our code whether it be getting our service back up and running after our service levels indicate it is too broken.

- Observability isn't just the data. It is not just these interfaces or abstraction of logs, metrics and traces. It's something else. Observability is our ability to write instrumentation in an ergonomic fashion so it is as easy as dropping in a debug print out statement to understand what's happening inside of our code to write that initial debug statement.

- Importance != demand for attention.
